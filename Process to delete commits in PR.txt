Process to delete commits in PR :

1)  First we have to checkout to the branch (from the branch we have raised the PR)

2)  Start an interactive rebase to rewrite history : run the command - "git rebase -i HEAD~6" (here 6 means it will retrieve the last 6 commits)

3)  After run the above command, an editor will open in terminal, in that it will shows the commits like :
    								pick 57f960c added pandas and openpyxl...
								pick f194a9d added api to download...
								pick fed4b4d added format_minutes...

4)  We have to change the word pick to "drop" for the commits whatever we want to delete, to edit we have to click "i" in keyboard the it will
    go to the editor mode.

5)  After changes has done, we have to escape from that edit mode, for that click "Esc" button.

6)  Then to save the changes in that editor, to save and quit from  that editor we have to type ":wq" and hit "Enter" button.

7)  Then force_push to update the PR : "git push origin feature/organisation_updated --force"
