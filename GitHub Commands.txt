	1) Global (affects all repos on your machine):

     	---> git config --global user.name "Your New Name"
     	---> git config --global user.email "your_new_email@example.com"


	2) Local (only for the current project): Go to your project folder in terminal (inside PyCharm or system terminal):

   	---> git config user.name "Your New Name"
   	---> git config user.email "your_new_email@example.com"


----->  You can rename a branch locally and remotely. Since you already pushed it, hereâ€™s the clean way:

	ðŸ”¹ 1. Rename branch locally

	    If you are on that branch right now:

	        ---> git branch -m new-branch-name

	    If you are on another branch:

		---> git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name

	ðŸ”¹ 2. Push the renamed branch to remote

	    	---> git push origin new-branch-name

	ðŸ”¹ 3. Delete the old branch from remote (Remove the incorrectly named one)

	    	---> git push origin --delete old-branch-name
