---> OAuth2PasswordBearer is a security utility class provided by FastAPI.

---> Extract the access token sent by clients in the HTTP Authorization header with the "Bearer" scheme.

OAuth2 "Password" Flow (How it Works Generally):

---> Client submits credentials (username & password) to a token endpoint (e.g., /token) via a POST request, usually with form-encoded body.

---> Server validates credentials. If valid, it creates a signed access token (usually a JWT).

---> Server returns access token to client.

---> Client sends API requests to protected endpoints with the access token in the Authorization header.

---> Server extracts and validates the token for each protected request using OAuth2PasswordBearer and your JWT verification logic.
