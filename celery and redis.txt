command to run the celery tasks : "celery -A src.celery_tasks.c_app worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo"

command to run the celery flower : "celery -A src.celery_tasks.c_app flower" (It is like a swagger)

 in a command src.celery_tasks.c_app (Its is a <folder_name>.<file_name>.<instance_name>)



If you're hitting performance or reliability limitations with FastAPI's BackgroundTasks, then you'll likely hear about Celery and Redis.
Let’s break it down simply:

✅ What Is Celery?

Celery is a powerful task queue system used to run background jobs, scheduled tasks, and asynchronous workers.
Think of it as an engine for executing tasks outside your FastAPI process
It works by delegating work to worker processes
It supports retries, scheduling, monitoring, and parallelism


✅ What Is Redis?

Redis is a fast, in-memory key-value data store. Celery uses it as a message broker — basically a middleman between FastAPI and Celery workers.
FastAPI adds tasks → Redis queues them → Celery workers pick them up
Redis ensures tasks are persisted and delivered, even if the app restarts

✅ Why Use Celery With FastAPI?

	Feature    	                 Why It's Useful
⚙️ Heavy Background Work	BackgroundTasks are limited — Celery can handle large workloads, long tasks
🔁 Retry Failed Jobs		Celery can retry failed email sending, database sync, etc.
🕒 Schedule Jobs		Run tasks every hour, daily, etc. (via Celery + beat)
🧵 Parallel Execution		Multiple Celery workers = parallel task processing
🛑 App Isolation		If Celery fails, FastAPI still works (tasks are isolated)
📈 Monitoring			You can monitor and control tasks using Flower (a web UI for Celery)



✅ Example Use Cases for Celery in FastAPI

---> Sending bulk emails to 1000+ users
---> Generating large reports or PDFs
---> Data syncing with third-party APIs
---> Scheduled database cleanup
---> Video encoding or file conversion
---> Retry failed API/webhook calls



🧠 When Should You Use Celery?

Use Celery when:

---> You have complex or long-running tasks
---> You need retry logic or task persistence
---> You’re building a scalable production system
---> You want scheduled jobs
---> You’re doing parallel processing

Use BackgroundTasks only for:

---> Very lightweight, quick tasks
---> No need for reliability, retry, or scale
